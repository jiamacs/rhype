Over the years there have been several contributors and contributions
to this project, much of it for demonstration purposes and much of it
completely replaced, reimplemented or removed.  I take full
responsibility for this list and its [in]completeness.  So if I missed
you then either I forgot or I meant to, but either way.. I thank you.
Let me know if you want to find out.
