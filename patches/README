Patches.. yes we need some stinking patches. :-)

This is a single diff that represets three distinct pieces of work.
  1. The Linux x86 patch.
  2. Commonized VIO layer, where the PPC64 VIO layer is "fixed" so it
     can target x86 as well.
  3. Teach the MAPLE PPC64 configureation to be hypervisor aware.
