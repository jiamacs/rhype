HOWTO: Running Linux

If you have not built your Linux kernel then see Build_Linux


Boot tasks that may be necessary for your environment, these tasks are
described below.
  Booting Linux X86
  =================
    In order to support any BIOS access that a linux boot image
    requires (not vmlinux), there is an additional CVS module called
    'lboot' that exists to support this scenario.  See the README of
    that module.
      *** Note: This is not necessary for PPC

  Booting on Simulator
  ====================
    The lboot module is also useful to avoid the uncompressing kernels
    when running on simulators.  So we have provided another module
    called 'lbootppc' that can allow you to avoid the compression
    stage.

  Device Tree
  ===========
    In order to use the Hypervisor Console device from a kernel _not_
    configured with devfs you will need to create the node on the root
    file system (as root):
      # mknod /dev/hvc0 c 229 0

  Console Login
  =============
    If you wish to login using the Hypervisor Console you will need to
    enable that in linux by running a getty similar to that run for a
    serial port.  See man pages for inittab(5) and the various gettys
    out there (getty, agetty, mingetty).
      ***Note if you with to login as root you need to add hvc0 to the
      securetty(5) list (as root):
        # echo hvc0 >> /etc/securetty
