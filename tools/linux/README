This directory includes the Linux user-space tools for managing an
rHype system (e.g. creating partitions).  These programs are intended
to run on a controller Linux partition that has the /dev/hcall
cut-thru device.

The tools in this directory must be built seperately and require
additional configuration.  

Enter the build-tree directory corresponding to this source directory
and invoke make with the following arguments:

make LINUX_BUILD=<????> LINUX_SRC=<????> PREFIX=<????>

LINUX_BUILD = root of Linux kernel build tree.
LINUX_SRC   = root of Linux kernel source tree.
PREFIX	    = location where files will be installed to 
	      (specifically, to $PREFIX/bin, $PREFIX/lib)

These variables can also be put into "Makefile.vars" in the
tools/linux build directory.

Note that PREFIX need not be the run-time location of these files.  If
the runtime path is /foo/bin/prog, it is expected that the lib dir
exists at /foo/lib.  This allows one to simply NFS-mount PREFIX to
some arbitrary location for running these programs.

After a build is complete, one must create the default OF device-tree in
$(PREFIX)/lib/hype/of_tree.

In the Linux partition which will be running these tools, one must
create a /var/hype directory.
