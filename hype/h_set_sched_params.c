/*
 * h_set_sched_params(per_cpu_os *pcop, uval lpid,
 *			uval cpu, uval required, uval desired)
 *
 * Temporary interface for setting scheduling parameters.
 *
 * required/desired are bitmaps that specify which slots the calling
 * OS wants.  Bits in "required" represent scheduling slots that must
 * be assignable to this OS (and locked down).  The desired bit-map
 * represents scheduling slots that may be set/unset, without guarantees at
 * any time by HV.  Thus fullfilling "desired" requests has no bearing
 * on the success/failure of this call.
 *
 * On return, r4 contains a bitmap identifying the locked-down slots
 * (which cannot be yielded to satisfy set_sched_params() calls of
 * other partitions).  r5 contains a bitmap representing all in-use
 * scheduling slots.  The caller can use this information to try again
 * if an error has occurred. r6 contains the bitmask actually assigned
 * (a rotation of "required").
 *
 * The return value, if positive (-> success) identifies the left-wise
 * rotation required of the input parameters to have fulfilled the request.
 *
 * FIXME: Should have a mechanism to restrict rights to calls this function
 *	  to the controlling OS only.
 *
 * FIXME: Re-implement using standard LPAR interfaces, if appropriate.
 *
 * Examples of usage in "test_sched.c".
