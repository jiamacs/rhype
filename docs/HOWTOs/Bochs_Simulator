Bochs is an open source IA-32 emulator. Here are the instructions for
running Research Hypervisor x86 under Bochs, you can find more info at:
  http://bochs.sf.net

We use GRUB, but you can use whatever you want.

*** WARNING: default configuration of Bochs is not sufficient to run
    Research Hypervisor since we assume 4M pages are available.  So
    your own build is necessary configuring with the
    "--enable-4meg-pages"

Example configuration:
  $ ./configure --enable-debugger --enable-disasm --enable-4meg-pages \
    --enable-x86-debugger --enable-readline --with-all-libs \
    --enable-iodebug --enable-ne2000 --enable-pci --prefix=/usr/local

QUICK START
===========

You can find a 10 MiB sample disk image that contains a sample
Research Hypervisor and Toy OSes (no Linux) called "hv10m.img" and a
sample bochsrc called "hv.bochsrc" at this link:

  <<< Web Page to be announced >>

To run you must first start thinwire like on a master pty (this example uses ptyx0),  your kernel may not have that many:
  $ <build_dir>/thinwire/runthinwire -T "-s\ 9600\ 9600" -d /dev/ptyx0 -p <n>

Where <n> is the number of partition (including controller) that you
wish to run, then in another terminal run:
  $ bochs -q -f hv.bochsrc

and you should see the one of the thinwire xterms (controller) asking
you which Toy OS to run.


Update Hypervisor on the disk image
===================================
You can mount this image on a Linux boc with the following command (as root):
  # mount -o loop,offset=0x4000 disk.img /mnt

Then copy your own hypervisor and controller by:
  # cp <build_dir>/hype/hype.boot <build_dir>/hype/controller.bin /mnt/boot
  # sync; umount /mnt


CREATE YOUR OWN DISK IMAGE
==========================

To create your own disk image use the bximage(1) command that came
with Bochs.  This will create a disk image file and give you the Disk
geometry information that Bochs will require, then the following need
to occur. You then need to format the disk image (assumes disk.img of
20Meg):
    $ parted disk.img
    (parted) mklabel msdos
    (parted) mkpartfs primary ext2 0 20
    (parted) set 1 boot on
    (parted) print
    Minor    Start       End     Type      Filesystem  Flags
    1          0.016     19.937  primary   ext2        boot


You will then need the GRUB files from some distro.  You can also
obtain them from the hv10m.img above.
  # mount -o loop,offset=0x4000 hv10m.img /mnt/hv
  # mount -o loop,offset=0x4000 disk.img /mnt/disk
  # cd /mnt/hv
  # find . | cpio -pdumv /mnt/disk
  # cd -
  # umount /mnt/hv
  # umount /mnt/disk

The easiest way to install GRUB on your new image is to make
"disk.img" a second disk in Bochs.  Boot hv10m.img and at the GRUB
menu prompt type 'c'.  You will now be in the GRUB console, type the
following commands:
  grub> root (hd1,0)
  grub> setup (hd1)
